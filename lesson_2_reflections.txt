What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creates a .git subdirectory and can start operating on the files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository because it's temporary.
	It gives a flexibility to add and remove files from the commit.
