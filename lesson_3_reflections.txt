When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I work in a team or when I work alone but want to show the project to a community for exchanging ideas.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually from the remote repository gives me better control over the state of both repositories. It would be dangerous if Git synced automatically because it can accidently override important changes in one of the repositories.
